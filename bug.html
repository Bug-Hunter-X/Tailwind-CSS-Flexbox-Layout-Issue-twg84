The following Tailwind CSS classes are not applied correctly:

```html
<div class="bg-gray-100 p-4">
  <div class="flex">
    <div class="w-1/2 bg-red-500"></div>
    <div class="w-1/2 bg-blue-500"></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

The expected output is a container with two equally sized divs, one red and one blue. However, the red div takes up the entire width of the container, while the blue div is not rendered.
